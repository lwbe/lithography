Things to keep in mind not ordered for now:

- code

  - clean the source tree (remove old source code, unused javascript and old docs)
  - get the javascript library to make the code stand alone (remove CDN)

- system

  - reorganize the folder on the server to get production and test website
  - set the correct uwsgi daemon with vassals
  - use https and decide the certificates to use (let's encrypt because of the automatice renewal or terena)

- website pages

  - create the info page to summarize stats (and to dump the site?)
  - create the search page.
  - edit the about page to create a doc.
